## **1. Introduction to IP Addressing**

An **IP address** (Internet Protocol address) is a numerical label assigned to devices in a network. It enables communication by uniquely identifying devices.

### **Key Points**
- Two primary versions:
  - **IPv4**: A 32-bit address system (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
  - **IPv6**: A 128-bit address system (e.g., `2001:db8::8a2e:370:7334`).
- IPv4 uses four octets separated by dots, each octet ranging from 0 to 255.

## **2. IP Address Structure**

An IPv4 address is a 32-bit binary number divided into **network** and **host** portions.

### **Binary Representation**
For example:
- \( 192.168.1.1 \):  
  \( 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001 \)

Each bit in an octet represents \( 2^n \) values, where \( n \) starts from 0 (rightmost bit).

---

### **2.1. Classes of IP Addresses**

IPv4 addresses are categorized into five classes, defined by the range of the **first octet**:

| **Class** | **Range**           | **Default Subnet Mask** | **Purpose**                |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| A         | 0.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255 | 255.0.0.0 (/8)      | Large networks            |
| B         | 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255 | 255.255.0.0 (/16)   | Medium-sized networks     |
| C         | 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255 | 255.255.255.0 (/24) | Small networks            |
| D         | 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255 | -                   | Multicast traffic         |
| E         | 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 | -                   | Experimental use          |

## **3. Subnetting Overview**

**Subnetting** is dividing a larger network into smaller subnetworks (subnets). This is useful for:
1. **Efficient IP Utilization**: Reduces wasted IP addresses.
2. **Traffic Management**: Limits broadcast traffic.
3. **Improved Security**: Segregates networks.

### **Key Terms**
1. **CIDR Notation**: Compact representation of the subnet mask (e.g., `/24` for \( 255.255.255.0 \)).
2. **Subnet Mask**: Defines the network and host portions of an IP address.

## **4. How Subnetting Works**

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Define Subnet Requirements**:
   - Number of subnets needed.
   - Number of hosts per subnet.

2. **Borrow Host Bits**:
   - Subnetting requires borrowing bits from the host portion.
   - Each borrowed bit doubles the number of subnets (\( 2^n \)).

3. **Subnet Range**:
   - The new subnet mask determines the range of each subnet.

4. **Calculate Usable Hosts**:
   - Subnets lose 2 addresses:
     - **Network Address**: The first address (e.g., \( 192.168.1.0 \)).
     - **Broadcast Address**: The last address (e.g., \( 192.168.1.255 \)).

### **Calculation for Usable Hosts**
\[
\text{Usable Hosts} = 2^{\text{Host Bits Left}} - 2
\]

#### **Why Subtract 2?**
1. **Network Address**: Used to identify the subnet itself.
2. **Broadcast Address**: Used for sending packets to all hosts in the subnet.

## **5. Example 1: Subnetting a Class C Network**

### **Scenario**
You have \( 192.168.1.0/24 \) and need **4 subnets**.

#### **Step 1: Determine Subnet Bits**
- \( /24 \): 8 host bits available.
- Borrow 2 bits (\( 2^2 = 4 \)).
- New subnet mask: \( /26 \) (\( 255.255.255.192 \)).

#### **Step 2: Binary Subnet Ranges**
Each subnet has \( 2^{6} = 64 \) addresses.

| **Subnet** | **Binary Range**                   | **Decimal Range**            |
|------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Subnet 1   | \( 192.168.1.00000000 \) - \( 192.168.1.00111111 \) | \( 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.63 \) |
| Subnet 2   | \( 192.168.1.01000000 \) - \( 192.168.1.01111111 \) | \( 192.168.1.64 - 192.168.1.127 \) |
| Subnet 3   | \( 192.168.1.10000000 \) - \( 192.168.1.10111111 \) | \( 192.168.1.128 - 192.168.1.191 \) |
| Subnet 4   | \( 192.168.1.11000000 \) - \( 192.168.1.11111111 \) | \( 192.168.1.192 - 192.168.1.255 \) |

#### **Step 3: Usable Hosts**
Each subnet has \( 64 - 2 = 62 \) usable hosts.

## **6. Example 2: Subnetting a Class B Network**

### **Scenario**
You have \( 172.16.0.0/16 \) and need **16 subnets**.

#### **Step 1: Determine Subnet Bits**
- \( /16 \): 16 host bits available.
- Borrow 4 bits (\( 2^4 = 16 \)).
- New subnet mask: \( /20 \) (\( 255.255.240.0 \)).

#### **Step 2: Binary Subnet Ranges**
Each subnet has \( 2^{12} = 4096 \) addresses.

| **Subnet** | **Binary Range**                   | **Decimal Range**                |
|------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Subnet 1   | \( 172.16.00000000.00000000 \) - \( 172.16.00001111.11111111 \) | \( 172.16.0.0 - 172.16.15.255 \) |
| Subnet 2   | \( 172.16.00010000.00000000 \) - \( 172.16.00011111.11111111 \) | \( 172.16.16.0 - 172.16.31.255 \) |

(Repeat for 16 subnets.)

#### **Step 3: Usable Hosts**
Each subnet has \( 4096 - 2 = 4094 \) usable hosts.

## **7. Understanding Subnetting Calculations**

### **Why Use \( 2^n \)?**
1. IP addressing is binary; each bit doubles the number of possible combinations.
2. Subnets and hosts depend on splitting the binary space of an address.

### **Why Subtract 2?**
- **Network Address**: Used by routers to identify the subnet.
- **Broadcast Address**: Used to send data to all devices in the subnet.

#### **Binary Example**
For \( 192.168.1.0/26 \):
- Total IPs: \( 2^6 = 64 \)
- Usable Hosts: \( 64 - 2 = 62 \)
  - \( 192.168.1.0 \): Network Address.


  - \( 192.168.1.63 \): Broadcast Address.

## **8. Common Mistakes in Subnetting**

1. **Forgetting Network and Broadcast Addresses**:
   - Always subtract 2 from total hosts.

2. **Over-Borrowing Bits**:
   - Borrowing too many bits reduces host availability.

3. **Misinterpreting CIDR**:
   - Ensure \( /n \) correctly represents the intended division.

## **9. Conclusion**

Subnetting is a critical networking skill that enables efficient IP address allocation and network segmentation. By understanding binary representation, subnet masks, and the \( 2^n - 2 \) rule, you can effectively design scalable and secure networks.
