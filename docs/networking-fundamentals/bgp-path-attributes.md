### **What is NEXT_HOP?**
1. **Definition**: The `NEXT_HOP` attribute in BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) tells the router which IP address should be used as the next stop to forward packets to the destination.

2. **Purpose**: It ensures that routers know the next step in the journey of a packet through the network.

3. **Key Rule**: This is a **mandatory attribute** that must always be set.

### **How is NEXT_HOP Determined?**
BGP determines the `NEXT_HOP` value differently depending on the type of connection (internal vs. external peers) and how far the destination is.

| **No.** | **Original Text** | **Explanation with Enhanced Clarification and Examples** |
|---------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**   | When sending a message to an internal peer, if the route is not locally originated, the BGP speaker SHOULD NOT modify the NEXT_HOP attribute unless it has been explicitly configured to announce its own IP address as the NEXT_HOP. | **1. Internal Peer (Within the Same Network)** <br> **Scenario**: When a router sends a route update to another router within the same organization or network. <br><br> **Rule**: When announcing a route to an internal peer, how the `NEXT_HOP` is handled depends on whether the route is **locally originated**. Locally originated routes are generated by the announcing router itself. For non-locally originated routes, the `NEXT_HOP` set by the original router should generally be preserved. <br> |
| **1.1** | If the route is not locally originated, the BGP speaker SHOULD NOT modify the NEXT_HOP attribute unless it has been explicitly configured to announce its own IP address as the NEXT_HOP. | **1.1. If the route is not locally originated:** <br> **Definition of Locally Originated**: A route is **locally originated** if it is directly created by the router itself (e.g., static routes or connected networks). Routes learned from another router are **not locally originated** for the receiving router. <br><br> **Rule**: Do **not** change the `NEXT_HOP` unless explicitly configured. Preserve the `NEXT_HOP` attribute set by the original announcing router. <br><br> **Practical Examples**: <br> **Example 1**: Router A learns about a route `192.168.1.0/24` from Router B (internal) with `NEXT_HOP = 172.16.0.1`. Router B is the originating router for this route (not Router A). Router A advertises this route to Router C (internal). Since this route is **not locally originated** for Router A, the `NEXT_HOP` remains `172.16.0.1` unless Router A is explicitly configured to override it. <br><br> **Example 2**: Router A is configured to keep the `NEXT_HOP` of incoming routes unchanged. Router B advertises the route `10.0.0.0/8` to Router A with `NEXT_HOP = 172.20.0.1`. Router A passes this route to Router C without modifying the `NEXT_HOP`. For Router A, this route is **not locally originated**, and it maintains `NEXT_HOP = 172.20.0.1`. Router C knows it must send packets to `172.20.0.1` to reach `10.0.0.0/8`. |
| **1.2** | When announcing a locally-originated route to an internal peer, the BGP speaker SHOULD use the interface address of the router through which the announced network is reachable for the speaker as the NEXT_HOP. | **1.2. If the route is locally originated:** <br> **Definition of Locally Originated**: Locally originated routes are created by the router itself (e.g., static routes, directly connected subnets, or redistributed routes). <br><br> **Rule**: Use the router's **own interface address** as the `NEXT_HOP`. This ensures that other routers know to forward traffic for the route through the announcing router. <br><br> **Practical Examples**: <br> **Example 1**: Router A originates a static route for `192.168.2.0/24` and advertises it to Router B. Router A sets its own interface address (`172.16.0.1`) as the `NEXT_HOP`. Router B knows to use Router A to forward traffic to this destination. <br><br> **Example 2**: If Router A is directly connected to the network `10.0.1.0/24` and announces it to Router B, Router A’s interface IP (`192.168.0.1`) is set as the `NEXT_HOP`. Router B knows to forward all packets for `10.0.1.0/24` to Router A. |
| **1.3** | If the route is directly connected to the speaker, or if the interface address of the router through which the announced network is reachable for the speaker is the internal peer's address, then the BGP speaker SHOULD use its own IP address for the NEXT_HOP attribute (the address of the interface that is used to reach the peer). | **1.3. If the route is directly connected or if the peer’s address is used to reach the network:** <br> **Rule**: The router sets its **own IP** as the `NEXT_HOP`. <br><br> **Practical Examples**: <br> **Example 1**: Router A is directly connected to the network `172.16.2.0/24`. It advertises this route to Router B (internal) with `NEXT_HOP = 172.16.2.1` (Router A’s IP). <br><br> **Example 2**: Router A connects directly to `192.168.3.0/24` and advertises the route to Router C. Router A’s interface IP `192.168.3.1` is used as the `NEXT_HOP`. <br><br> **Example 3**: Router A connects to an internal subnet used for application servers (`10.20.30.0/24`). When advertising this route to Router B, Router A uses `NEXT_HOP = 10.20.30.1`. |
| **2**   | When sending a message to an external peer, X, and the peer is one IP hop away from the speaker: | **2. External Peer (One Hop Away)** <br> **Scenario**: When a router sends a route update to a router outside its network. <br><br> **Rule**: Determine `NEXT_HOP` based on the origin of the route. |
| **2.1** | If the route being announced was learned from an internal peer or is locally originated, the BGP speaker can use an interface address of the internal peer router (or the internal router) through which the announced network is reachable for the speaker for the NEXT_HOP attribute, provided that peer X shares a common subnet with this address. | **2.1. If the route came from an internal peer or is locally originated:** <br> **Rule**: Use the IP of the **internal peer/router**, **if the external peer shares a subnet** with this address. <br><br> **Practical Examples**: <br> **Example 1**: Router A (internal) learns the route `10.10.10.0/24` from Router B (internal) with `NEXT_HOP = 172.16.0.1`. Router A advertises this to Router C (external), keeping `NEXT_HOP = 172.16.0.1` since Router C shares the same subnet. <br><br> **Example 2**: Router A advertises a locally originated route `192.168.5.0/24` to Router B (internal) with `NEXT_HOP = 172.20.0.1`. Router B forwards it to an external Router C, keeping `NEXT_HOP = 172.20.0.1` as they share a subnet. |
| **3**   | When sending a message to an external peer X, and the peer is multiple IP hops away from the speaker (aka "multihop EBGP"): | **3. External Peer (Multiple Hops Away)** <br> **Scenario**: When the external peer is not directly reachable (e.g., requires multiple routers). <br><br> **Rule**: Use the `NEXT_HOP` received or your connection interface as the default. |

### **Key Principles of NEXT_HOP**
1. **Shortest Path**: The `NEXT_HOP` is typically chosen to ensure the shortest path is taken.
2. **No Self-Reference**:
   - A router cannot use its own IP as the `NEXT_HOP`.
3. **No Peer’s Address**:
   - A route cannot be advertised to a peer using that peer’s own address as the `NEXT_HOP`.

---

### **How is the NEXT_HOP Used?**
1. **Route Lookup**: The `NEXT_HOP` is used to look up the Routing Table.
   - The Routing Table determines:
     - The **outbound interface** (e.g., Ethernet0, Serial1).
     - The **immediate next-hop address** (e.g., `192.168.1.2`).

2. **Example**:
   - Routing Table Entry: 
     - Destination: `10.0.0.0/24`
     - NEXT_HOP: `192.168.1.2`
     - Outbound Interface: `Ethernet0`

   When sending a packet to `10.0.0.5`, the router forwards it to `192.168.1.2` via `Ethernet0`.
