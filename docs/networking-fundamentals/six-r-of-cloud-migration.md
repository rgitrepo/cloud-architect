### The Six R's of Cloud Migration

This document is a companion to the *Six R's of Cloud Migration* video in the Intro to Technology Course. By reading this document and reviewing the video lesson, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of cloud migration strategies. For effective learning, it is recommended to use both the document and the video together.

### Introduction to Cloud Migration

Cloud migration is the process of moving an organization's applications, data, and services from traditional on-premises data centers to the cloud. It offers several benefits, including:

- Increased business agility
- Cost reduction
- Promotion of digital transformation

However, migrating to the cloud requires careful planning and consideration of various strategies. In this document, we will explore the six R's of cloud migration, each representing a unique approach for transitioning IT infrastructure to the cloud.

### 1. **Rehosting (Lift and Shift)**

Rehosting, commonly referred to as "lift and shift," is the most straightforward cloud migration strategy. Organizations move their existing systems, applications, and data from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud with minimal or no changes. 

- **Advantages**: 
  - Quick and cost-effective
  - Minimal disruption to operations
- **Limitations**: 
  - Does not fully utilize cloud-native features and capabilities

---

### 2. **Replatforming (Lift, Tinker, and Optimize)**

Replatforming involves slight modifications to applications to optimize them for the cloud environment while maintaining their core architecture.

- **Key Features**:
  - Incorporates cloud-specific enhancements
  - Refactors certain components to leverage cloud-native services
- **Advantages**:
  - Balances speed and optimization
  - Provides partial benefits of cloud without complete application overhaul

---

### 3. **Repurchasing (Software as a Service - SaaS)**

Repurchasing shifts to cloud-native software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions instead of managing on-premises applications.

- **Examples**:
  - Transitioning from on-premises email servers to services like Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace
- **Advantages**:
  - Simplifies application management
  - Shifts responsibility to the cloud service provider

---

### 4. **Refactoring (Optimizing for the Cloud)**

Refactoring, also known as "re-architecting," involves rebuilding applications to fully utilize cloud-native features and capabilities.

- **Key Features**:
  - Incorporates serverless computing, microservices architecture, and other cloud-native services
- **Advantages**:
  - Improved scalability, performance, and cost efficiency
- **Challenges**:
  - Requires significant changes to application code and architecture
  - Most expensive and time-intensive approach

---

### 5. **Retiring (Shutting Down Unnecessary Systems)**

Retiring involves decommissioning systems, applications, or services that are no longer needed in the cloud environment.

- **Advantages**:
  - Streamlines migration by reducing unnecessary resources
  - Lowers costs by eliminating outdated infrastructure

---

### 6. **Retaining (Staying On-Premises)**

Retaining involves keeping certain applications or systems on-premises due to:

- Complex dependencies
- Performance requirements
- Regulatory compliance

This strategy allows organizations to delay migration until a more suitable approach becomes viable.

### Conclusion

Cloud migration is a pivotal step in modernizing IT infrastructure and unlocking the benefits of cloud computing. Each of the six R's offers distinct advantages and considerations, and the choice of strategy depends on:

- The organization's needs
- Available resources
- Long-term goals

| **Strategy**     | **Purpose**                           | **Best For**                          |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Rehosting         | Quick migration with minimal changes | Cost-effective, low-disruption needs  |
| Replatforming     | Minor optimization for the cloud     | Balance of speed and optimization     |
| Repurchasing      | Transition to SaaS solutions         | Simplified application management     |
| Refactoring       | Full cloud-native optimization       | Scalability, cost efficiency, innovation |
| Retiring          | Remove outdated systems              | Streamlining and cost reduction       |
| Retaining         | Stay on-premises for now             | Complex dependencies or compliance    |

When planning a cloud migration, organizations should assess their existing infrastructure, business requirements, and desired outcomes. With the right approach, cloud migration can enhance efficiency, scalability, and innovation, enabling success in the digital era.

1. **Rehost**: **Tent**  
   - A temporary, portable home that mirrors lifting and shifting workloads to a new environment with minimal change.

2. **Replatform**: **Stage**  
   - Represents a platform that supports a slightly adapted setup, fitting for minor upgrades during migration.

3. **Refactor**: **Workshop**  
   - Suggests a place for rebuilding or fine-tuning, aligning with overhauling applications for optimization.

4. **Repurchase**: **Shopping Bag**  
   - A clear visual for buying something new, like replacing software with ready-made solutions.

5. **Retire**: **Gravestone**  
   - Symbolizes the phasing out or decommissioning of outdated systems, straightforward and evocative.

6. **Retain**: **Vault**  
   - A secure and preserved space for items that stay in their original environment.
