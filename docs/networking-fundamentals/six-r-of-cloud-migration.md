The Six R's of Cloud MigrationThis is a companion document to Six R's of Cloud Migration Video in the Intro to Technology Course. By reading this document and reviewing the video lesson, you will have an understanding of the topic covered. Do not rely on only the document or only the video lesson, please use both pieces of content in your learning.Cloud migration is the process of moving an organization's applications, data, and services from their traditional on-premises data centers to the cloud. Cloud migrations offer numerous benefits, including increased business agility, cost reduction, and the promotion of digital transformation. However, migrating to the cloud requires careful planning and consideration of various migration strategies. In this article, we will explore the six R's of cloud migration, each representing a distinct approach that organizations can take to transition their IT infrastructure to the cloud.Rehosting (Lift and Shift):Rehosting, also known as "lift and shift,", is the most common cloud migration strategy. In rehosting, organizations simply move their existing systems, applications, and data from their on-premises infrastructure to the cloud without making any significant changes. It is a straightforward and quick method of migrating to the cloud, as it involves replicating the current setup in the cloud environment. Rehosting is ideal for organizations seeking a fast and cost-effective migration with minimal disruption. However, it may not take full advantage of cloud-native features and capabilities.

In this approach, organizations make slight modifications to their applications to take advantage of certain cloud-specific enhancements. For example, they might refactor certain components of the application to leverage cloud-native services. Replatforming strikes a balance between speed and cloud optimization, providing some of the benefits of the cloud without requiring a complete application overhaul.Repurchasing (Software as a Service - SaaS):Repurchasing involves migrating to cloud-native software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. Instead of hosting and managing software applications on-premises, organizations subscribe to SaaS solutions offered by cloud providers. Examples of repurchasing include moving from on-premises email servers to cloud-based email services like Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace. Repurchasing simplifies application management and maintenance, as the responsibility shifts to the cloud service provider.Refactoring (Optimizing for the Cloud):Refactoring, also known as "re-architecting," involves rebuilding applications from scratch to fully leverage cloud-native features. It is the most transformational but also the most expensive migration strategy. By refactoring applications, organizations can take full advantage of serverless computing, microservices architecture, and other cloud-native services. Refactoring often requires significant changes to application code and architecture but can result in long-term benefits in terms of scalability, cost efficiency, and improved performance.

It streamlines the migration process by eliminating unnecessary resources and reducing costs associated with maintaining outdated infrastructure.Retaining (Staying On-Premises):Retaining is a strategy where organizations decide not to migrate certain applications or systems to the cloud. It may be due to various factors such as complex dependencies, performance requirements, or regulatory compliance. Organizations might choose to retain their on-premises infrastructure until they are ready for a more suitable migration approach.Conclusion:Cloud migration is a crucial step in modernizing IT infrastructure and unlocking the full potential of cloud computing. Each cloud migration strategy offers distinct advantages and considerations, and the choice of approach depends on the organization's specific needs, resources, and goals. Rehosting and replatforming are ideal for quick and straightforward migrations, while repurchasing and refactoring offer opportunities for cloud optimization and transformation. Retiring and retaining strategies provide flexibility in managing legacy systems and making strategic decisions for the future.
